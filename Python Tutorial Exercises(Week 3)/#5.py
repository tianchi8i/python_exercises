'''
this script uses both for loop and while loop to add the name “TROLL” to words that are 5 characters or less, in the given list 'list_of_names'. 
Create a new list 'z' to store the words that satisfy the condition. 

Use the for/while loop and 'i'/'x' to list all the items in the given list 'list_of_names'.

 If len(i) <= 5, add the name "TROLL" after the words that meet the condition and 
 store the old name list and "TROLL" to the new list "z" by the new order.
