This script takes an inputs number 's' and stores the number to the 'total_number' list 
and adds a number to the 'week_number' list to count the weeks. When the 'total_number' 
is greater than the goal then print the number of weeks that have passed and 
the final amount he has saved once the goal has been reached.
